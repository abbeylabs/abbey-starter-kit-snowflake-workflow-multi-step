This example shows how to create a multistep Grant Kit workflow.
The example features requesting access to a [Snowflake Role Grant](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake/latest/docs/resources/role_grants) 
in two sequential steps, with the first step requiring all reviewers to approve access and 
the second step requiring just one reviewer to approve access.
